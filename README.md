# signals-and-systems

MATLAB Live demonstrations of Signals and Systems concepts. I created these for in-class demonstration of concepts in my undergraduate courses.

The scripts follow the chapters in *Signals and Systems* by Oppenheim and Willsky:

Ch. 1: Introduction to Signals and Systems

Ch. 3: Fourier Series

Ch. 4: Continuous-time Fourier Transform

Ch. 5: Discrete-time Fourier Transform

Ch. 6: Time and Frequency Characterization of Signals and Systems

Ch. 7: The Sampling Theorem

Ch. 9: The Laplace Transform

Feel free to use them in your teaching and/or study.
